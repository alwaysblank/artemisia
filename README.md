## Theme setup

Edit `src/setup.php` to enable or disable theme features, setup navigation menus, post thumbnail sizes, and sidebars.

## Theme development

Sage uses [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) as a build tool and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to manage front-end packages.

### Install dependencies

From the command line on your host machine (not on your Vagrant development box), navigate to the theme directory then run `yarn`:

```shell
# @ themes/your-theme-name/
$ yarn
```

You now have all the necessary dependencies to run the build process.

### Build commands

* `yarn run start` — Compile assets when file changes are made, start Browsersync session
* `yarn run build` — Compile and optimize the files in your assets directory
* `yarn run build:production` — Compile assets for production

#### Additional commands

* `yarn run rmdist` — Remove your `dist/` folder
* `yarn run lint` — Run ESLint against your assets and build scripts
* `composer test` — Check your PHP for PSR-2 compliance with `phpcs`

### Using Browsersync

To use Browsersync you need to update `devUrl` at the bottom of `assets/config.json` to reflect your local development hostname.

If your local development URL is `https://project-name.dev`, update the file to read:
```json
...
  "devUrl": "https://project-name.dev",
...
```

If you are not using [Bedrock](https://roots.io/bedrock/), update `publicPath` to reflect your folder structure:

```json
...
  "publicPath": "/wp-content/themes/sage"
...
```

By default, Browsersync will use webpack's [HMR](https://webpack.github.io/docs/hot-module-replacement.html), which won't trigger a page reload in your browser.

If you would like to force Browsersync to reload the page whenever certain file types are edited, then add them to `watch` in `assets/config.json`.

```json
...
  "watch": [
    "assets/scripts/**/*.js",
    "templates/**/*.php",
    "src/**/*.php"
  ],
...
```
